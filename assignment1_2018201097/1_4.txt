The storage complexity and flops for multiplication using various storage schemes:

Matrix one dimensions m*n
Matrix two dimensions n*k

1.Dense matrix:
	storage complexity:   m*n+n*k     
        Flops for multiplication: 2*m*n*k

2.Banded matrices:
        storage complexity: (p+q+1)*n ,where p and q are lower and upper bands
	Flops for multiplication: 2*n*n*(min(p1,q1,p2,q2))

3.Coordinate Storage Format (COO):
	storage complexity: 3(l+b) where l and b are the number of non zero values in matrix 1 and 2
	Flops for multiplication: 2*l*b

4.Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Format:
	storage complexity: less than 3(l+b)
	Flops for multiplication: 2*l*(n) where n is the size of row of 2nd matrix
